### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

  Lab 7, part 1, was one of my favorites because we made a complex program and made it into smaller chunks of fuctions so it is easier to understand. Also understanding how to use the ```std::stoi()``` function is really helpful for future projects. 
* Lab 8 

  Lab 8, part 1, is one of my favorites because this is one of the first times we worked with command line arguments. This lab was about creating different number of sandwich outputs depending on the arguments given to us by the user before they even run the program. We put them in a ```std::vecotr``` variable and depending what is given to us by the user we output a different result. 
* Lab 10

  Lab 10, part 2, is the last of my favorite labs. This lab is about working with 2D vectors. I liked this lab because it exposed me to working with 2D vectors, getting information from the vector, and organizing information from the 2D vector.
